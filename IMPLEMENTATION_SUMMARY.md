# 7-Layer Security Pipeline Implementation Summary (Phraser Adaptation)

## Scope

Adapted from the RepoSec 7-layer model to this repository:

- Repo: `Phraser`
- Stack: Tauri (Rust backend) + React/TypeScript + Bun
- Date: 2026-03-04

## What Was Added

### 1. Security Framework Docs

- `docs/7_LAYER_SECURITY_MODEL.md`
- `docs/PIPELINE.md`

These documents map the seven layers to Phraser-specific tooling and risks, including settings/logging exposure, Tauri command boundaries, and lockfile integrity.

### 2. CI Security Workflow

- `.github/workflows/security.yml`

Adds layer-oriented CI jobs:

- L1: `bun audit`, `cargo audit`
- L2: `gitleaks`
- L3: `bun run lint`, `cargo clippy`
- L4/L5/L7: review/runtime/observability reminders
- L6: lockfile-enforced installs + lockfile drift check

### 3. Local Security Make Targets

- `Makefile`

Provides reproducible local commands:

- `make security`
- `make security-l1` … `make security-l7`

### 4. Pre-commit Template

- `.pre-commit-config.yaml.template`

Template includes:

- gitleaks
- standard file hygiene checks
- local Bun lint
- Rust fmt check
- Rust clippy

## Design Notes

- Keeps existing project workflows intact (no modifications to existing CI files).
- Uses tools aligned with current stack and prior repo usage.
- Avoids hardcoded local user paths.
- Keeps the 7-layer model practical for a desktop app (L5 via runtime/integration checks, not only web DAST).

## Recommended Next Steps

1. Run `make security` locally and resolve any findings.
2. Trigger `.github/workflows/security.yml` on a PR to validate CI execution.
3. Copy `.pre-commit-config.yaml.template` to `.pre-commit-config.yaml` and install hooks.
4. Optionally pin all workflow actions to immutable SHAs for stronger supply-chain guarantees.

## Files Added

- `.github/workflows/security.yml`
- `Makefile`
